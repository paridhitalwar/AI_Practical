# if this doesn't work then probabaly fuzzywuzzy is not installed so for that do this:
# pip install fuzzywuzzy


from fuzzywuzzy import process
str2Match = "apple inc"
strOptions = ["Apple Inc.","apple park","apple incorporated","iphone"]
Ratios = process.extract(str2Match,strOptions)
print(Ratios)
# You can also select the string with the highest matching percentage
highest = process.extractOne(str2Match,strOptions)
print(highest)
